# Game With a Purpose

* Games with Purpose was created to showcase the best games that do more than just entertain.

* It will feature an ever-growing selection of learning, serious, news, social impact and meaningful games. Our aim is to recognise those that most successfully blend fun, quality and objectives with a view to help new audiences discover and play them.
